# top-landing-page-project

This is the landing page that I built through The Odin Project's Foundations course. 

I decided to have even more fun with the project and added a pug theme to the page. It gradually evolved into a Crypto-meme token. Pugcoin ftw!

This project was a bit challenging at first, because I wasn't so accustomed to implementing so many divs into a single index.html file.

Somewhere along the line, I had that "aha" moment, and then it became really instinctive to use them. 

I also really started to notice this page come to life when I combined flexbox with margin and padding properties.

I want to give credit to the artists that allowed me to use their pug images on this landing page.
